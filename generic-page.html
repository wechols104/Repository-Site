						<h1>Primary Research</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect research about your client as they exist today. This should focus on the website that you will be working on, but also focus on other design and marketing collateral that has been produced by your client. Include existing branded elements that they may have published online, print collateral, guidelines, advertisements, social media, and any other relevant material. This will help you understand how your client exists in the broader community, and how they portray themselves in other contexts - not just digital.</p>

					<p><strong>What they do:</strong> Founded in 2004, Games for Change facilitates the creation and distribution of social impact games that serve as critical tools in humanitarian and educational efforts.</p>
					<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Games for Change runs game design challenges for the public and professional communities, Fellowships programs that engage college/university students, and a year-round impact game design program and competition for middle and high school students, called the G4C Student Challenge.</p>
					<p><strong>Consulting:</strong> G4C partners with organizations seeking support for a range of services involving games and impact. G4C offers strategic workshops, vendor selection, project management and executive production. Collaborating with designers, academics, subject matter experts and researchers alike, G4C provides vision, continuity and support through the duration of the project.</p>
					<p><strong>Sector-Building:</strong> XR for Change is a year-round initiative powered by Games for Change that seeks to unify developers, storytellers, researchers, technology companies and users to create experiences that have a shared mission to improve people’s lives.</p>

						<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore the most recent news in your client's field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, or journals to know what’s new. This can be news stories of interest, relevant scientific research, or anything that could help you in finding a solution to the design challenge.</p>

					<ul><strong>Games Engage Students</strong>
						<li>One reason to promote educatonal games is to encourage students to learn outside of class. Young adults will go out of their way to play games, even a single game, for hours on end.</li>
						<li>There is also evidence that games allow students to focus well enough to learn better. Lepper and Cordova, 1992 have found that rewriting a lesson with a story context combined with a challenge for the student to overcome (in other words, making it into a game) significantly improves the learning performance of children.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul><strong>Learning From Mistakes</strong>
						<p>One reason that games (outside of gambling) are such a great escape from the real world is that bad consequences are rarely serious or lasting.</p>
						<li>"It's only a game."</li>
						<li>If you lose, start the game over and try again.</li>
						<li>Often, it's possible to recover within a game, and to use what you have learned to successfully complete a task.</li>
						<li>Characters and pieces may die, but this is rarely permanent.</li>
						<li>There are no consequences for the player personally.</li><br>
						<p><strong>Grades can tell students if they have failed to learn something, but for a variety of reasons, students may not make good use of that feedback.</strong></p>
						<li>By the time students get their grades, it's often too late to do anything about them. So it's not possible to correct mistakes.
						</li>
						<li>The value of grades is for rewards that are not part of the learning process like parental approval, reduced car insurance, access to a good job or medical school.
						</li>
						<li>There is probably no way to escape from giving grades, but games that allow students to assess their knowledge for themselves give them a chance to see where they are having trouble before a test.
						</li>
