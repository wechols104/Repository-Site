						<h1>Primary Research</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect research about your client as they exist today. This should focus on the website that you will be working on, but also focus on other design and marketing collateral that has been produced by your client. Include existing branded elements that they may have published online, print collateral, guidelines, advertisements, social media, and any other relevant material. This will help you understand how your client exists in the broader community, and how they portray themselves in other contexts - not just digital.</p>
