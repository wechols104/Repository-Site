						<h2>Mrs. Peake Interview</h2>
						<p>One of my greatest teachers through my education has always been my second grade teacher Mrs. Peake. She was childhood best friends with my mom and she has taught both me and my 3 little brothers. There is no one better than her to give an accurate and genuine account of educational games.</p>
						<br>
						<strong>What are your thoughts on games in the classroom?</strong><br>
						Games in the classroom are a great outlet for kids that are "early finishers" and need something that is more hands on. (kinesthetic and tactile learners) Kids that need to get away from paper and pencil. Games break up the routine. Rather than calling them games, we call them <strong>challenge time activities</strong>. The games make them think out of the box and think in a different way. Many of the things we do in class are 1 player however some lessons benefit from a 2 player or multiplayer game.
						<br><br>
						<strong>What subjects work best with games?</strong><br>
						The subject I used games for the most often was math, but you can get creative and make a game for any subject. Math games can have more manipulatives that lead to thinking mathmatically. You can also use trivia games for science or social studies. The hardest subject to use a game for would be ELA and reading. Maybe the difficulty to play games in these subjects is the reason a lot of students dont view reading as fun. 
						<br><br>
						<strong>What do you look for in educational games?</strong><br>
						Something that is going to catch the students eye and grab their attention. Something that is colorful, different, and intriguing. The game should cause the student to question things and want to know more about the game. I try to use games that the students do not have at home or have never seen before so that way it's new and makes the student want to play. 
						<br><br>
						<strong>How much of a future do games have in the classroom?</strong><br>
						I think there is a big outlet in the future for games. Students used to dream of being basketball players and football players. Now when you ask kids what they want to be when they grow up they say a gamer or a YouTuber. There is also a shift away from hands on physical games and growing towards electronic games.
						<br><br>
						<strong>How do games help children with tech skills?</strong><br>
						It is amazing how kids can move around and get through technology. I was doing a virtual meeting with my 4th grade students the other day and I had to ask them how to do something on the computer.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Do you think as the generations change education will have to change with them?</strong><br>
						Yes I think we will have to stay parallel with technology to keep up. Thats what kids are into and thats what the generation is interested in. Especially with the pandemic, education had to turn to technology to keep going. To stay up with the times education will have to turn towards technology rather than traditional paper and pencil. It has been amazing to me how many kids begged to close the computer and wanted to get back to a lesson on the board or pencil and paper because they got tired of staring at a screen.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Is there anyone among the teachers or administrators that dislike games in the classroom?</strong><br>
						I have not met an admin or teacher that doesnt like games. I think there has to be a good balance. Administration has always told us if we're going to play games make sure we balance it with the teaching and the foundation behind the game. Make sure students understand the reason behind the game.
						<br><br>
						<strong>At what point in the lesson process are games best administered?</strong><br>
						Often times I will use a game as my hook to get students excited about new content. Sometimes teaching something like fractions can be so mundane and boring to a student. So to get a child hooked on fractions or multiplication I'll throw in a game of kahoot to get a child excited about learning, rather than waiting until the end to play a game.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Do you think a game could ever act as a test?</strong><br>
						I do. In a room full of twenty kids, not all of them will learn the same. Personally, instead of having a fill in the blank or multiple choice, sometimes I will use quizlet or kahoot to administer the test.
						<br><br>
						<strong>Is there a certain age where games do not work in the classroom?</strong><br>
						I am kind of on the fence about that one. I kind of think of highschool kids thinking games are childish. But I could also see a highschool kid wishing school was fun like it was back in elementary school. I think it depends in the type of game and how interesting you make it. I think any age level child could enjoy a game.

							<h2>Bennett Interview</h2>
							<p>Bennett Clark is a good friend of mine who has made several independent games of his own. His game developer insight and knowledge of the current gaming industry makes a perfect perspective for the developer side of the educational game conversation.</p>
							<br>
							<strong>How would educational games affect the gaming industry?</strong><br>
							It depends on what kind of education we're talking about. If we're talking in a broader sense I can use minecraft for an example. Minecraft started out as a game just for fun to now it has a distinct educational portion to the game. So if game developers know how to make a game that can be used in core curriculum it would be beneficial to the industry. Not only would it increase the consumer base but it would also increase awareness of your game in the market. If you make games for the purpose of education it would actually be beneficial to games as an art form as well since theres new experiences that can open up with that.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Do you think games becoming prevalent in education would change the negative stigma on games as a waste of time?</strong><br>
							I think it would definitely have an impact on the stigma. If you look historically at new media being introduced whether it be TV or newspapers, people will complain about it because its new and misunderstood. Especially since the game industry hasnt been in the mainstream light until just recently. Once a few more years pass people will most likely begin to accept games more. I dont think the stigma will hold the industry back in any way.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Do you think games could become as common in education as documentaries and movies have become?</strong><br>
							I think in the future the chances are high. When designing an educational game a big factor to consider is <strong>accessibility</strong>. In a classroom setting you have kids of all abilities and you dont want to leave anyone behind. In the past companies have tried to sell to parents, however if you provide the games the way documentaries are provided that opens up a whole new market. Selling to the parents might sell one copy, but marketing the game to the schools will sell far more.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Do you think gaming equipment will ever be on the school supplies isle?</strong><br>
							I could definitely see virtual reality becoming a big part of that. Especially when looking at college you have medical students and situations where it would not be ethical or possible to practice the scenario anywhere other than in a virtual simulation. The military has also utilized VR to train roles such as pilots and other high intensity jobs. Games can offer the experience without having to throw the learner in the situation for real.
							<br><br>
							<strong>What does a game need to be interesting?</strong><br>
							A game needs to be engaging above all else. It's a common misconception that games need to be fun. A game does not need to be fun to be engaging. Players are not having fun when they lose in a game but if they're engaged then they will continue trying until they succeed, this is where games can be a very useful tool in education. That is the major flaw with educational games and why the industry hasnt seen a big push into education: because they try to appeal to much to kids with bright colors and simplicity to the point where it backfires and the kids lose interest. If the game focuses too much on being fun then the kids wont retain the information. The game should be designed with the intent of opening up new facets of learning for the children rather than becoming an easy day for the teacher or lesson.
							<br><br>
							<strong>How does a developer create a relationship between unlocking in-game items and learning real life education?</strong><br>
							3 prime examples of this: Duolingo, Quizlet, and Kahoot. These 3 are already common games that have been accepted as educational tools. Duolingo uses a streak system, where users are rewarded for completing lessons on the game daily. This positive reinforcement not only motivates the user to return to the game but it also creates a visual correlation between what they see in the game and what they learn in real life. Kahoot uses another strong sytem which is that of a leaderboard. The aspect of competition motivates kids to want to learn more. They care more about being the top of the leaderboard than they do about how boring the subject can be. Quizlet creates a visual separation between what the user understands and what they do not, and as the user inputs right answers the gap between what they know and dont begins to close creating motivation.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Do you think the gaming industry can support making both entertainment games as well as educational ones?</strong><br>
							I think it will be the same as the film industry. No one would say the documentary side of film has overtaken other genres of film. There has been different phases in gaming and educational games could easily become a phase. I do believe the industry can easily support both. Many games wont be educational on the surface but there is information that the user subconsciously learns through experienceing the game. Educational games dont have to be void of entertainment and vice-versa. Many entertainment games emerse the player in an environment that inherently teaches them about something that they did not previously understand. Games create agency and require the player to act, which can involve a student far more than watching a documentary could. So for entertainment and education it doesnt have to be one or the other in games.
							<br><br>
							<strong>What can a game not teach?</strong><br>
							Games should be supplemental to teaching, not a replacement. We can use games for education but we should never use games for everything. The one thing important in school that games dont provide is the social experience. Even though there is online chats there is nothing like talking face-to-face person to person. 
							<br><br>
							<strong>What is the biggest downfall of existing educational games?</strong><br>
							Accessibility. A game should be applicable to any level students education within the given topic the game is based on. A developer can add challenge into the game to require the student to use thought, however the game should never be discouraging. If the student quits the game because they could not pass a level or understand the solution then the game has failed its duty of educating the student.
							<br><br>
							<strong>How does a game offer a good mix of challenge and understanding?</strong><br>
							A strong aspect that can be added in games is optional challenge and difficulty settings. This way the game can adhere to several levels of users and therefore broaden its applicable audience. One student may not give up until they have discovered the solution themselves. Another student may prefer taking their best shot and if incorrect the game shows and teaches them the correct solution. Overall if the designer does not focus on making a good game, all other aspects of the game are going to fail to work. Kids now days can easily tell a good game from a bad game and a bad educational game is worse than a traditional chalkboard lesson. Ultimately a good educational game should create an enjoyable and engaging experience that leads the student to the correct solution.
